# :deciduous_tree: CSC 380 HW#4 Setup Instructions

The start-up code is a notebook file, **"hw4_llm_rag-starter.ipynb"**.  Your task is to fill in the sections marked '# TODO' (1) through (5), plus code for Experiment 2 and 3. You must also write your name, course number etc. at the top of the file.

Input data files are placed under the subdirectory 'data'.

Note that this assignment emphasizes on **analysis**, which you write in the WRITE-UP REPORT, equally with the code implementation.  See the [assignment page](https://condor.depaul.edu/ntomuro/courses/380/2025Fall/assign/HW4/hw4-2025fall.html) for details.
